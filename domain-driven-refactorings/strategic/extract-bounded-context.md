## Motivation

A legacy system is full of domain knowledge that is probably documented nowhere else. Sometimes thereâ€™s is even no more domain expert who has this knowledge. To save that knowledge into the modern world, transform it into a new bounded context.

## Mechanics

- Analyze the domain to find out which bounded contexts should be there.
- Identify first carve-out candidate.
- Apply the tactical refactorings for strategic transformation that are right for your situation. Often these are [Extract Specialized Entity](../tactical-for-strategic/extract-specialized-entity), [Extract Specialized Anemic Entity](../tactical-for-strategic/extract-specialized-anemic-entity), [Extract Specialized Service](../tactical-for-strategic/extract-specialized-service), and/or [Extract Specialized Table](../tactical-for-strategic/extract-specialized-table).
