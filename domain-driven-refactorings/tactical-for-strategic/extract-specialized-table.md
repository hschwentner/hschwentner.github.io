Type: Database refactoring

*A special case of [Split Table](https://databaserefactoring.com/SplitTable.html)*

## Motivation

As one step of [Extract Bounded Context](../strategic/extract-bounded-context) youâ€™ve found a monolithic data model. (Often used to store a monolithic domain model.) In this data model you have identified a table that has become too big. The decision has been made to separate the parts for the newly extracted bounded context.

## Mechanics

- Create an empty new table in the database scheme of the carved-out context
- *** REfe***
- Copy to-be-moved columns from old to new table => [Move Column](https://databaserefactoring.com/MoveColumn.html)
- Copy to-be-moved triggers
- ...
